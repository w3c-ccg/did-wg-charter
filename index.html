          <h1>Draft</h1>

          <p>
This is a <em>proposed</em> charter for a Decentralized Identifier Working Group, currently
undergoing development by the W3C Credentials Community Group; this is the development version.
It is available on <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-wg-charter/">GitHub</a>.
You may raise issues on this document 
<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-wg-charter/issues">issues</a> to help further discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
Items (mostly URL-s), that will need updates if and when the charter are accepted, are 
marked <span class="todo">thusly</span>.

      <h1 id="title">Decentralized Identifier Working Group Charter</h1>

        <p>
URL identifiers in use on the Web today (2019) require that the identifier be
leased from an authority such as a Domain Name Registrar. The advent of
Blockchains and Decentralized Ledger Technologies have led to innovations
around a new type of URL, called a Decentralized Identifier (DID). DIDs have
benefits over more traditional URLs:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
DIDs are controlled by individuals, organizations, and machines, not leased from
an authority (e.g., DNS Registrars).
          </li>
          <li>
The controller of a DID can cryptographically authenticate themselves
(e.g., DID-based website login).
          </li>
          <li>
DIDs provide discovery information for bootstrapping into more secure and
privacy preserving communication protocols (e.g., encrypted messaging endpoints).
          </li>
          <li>
DIDs provide a path to service agnostic data portability
(e.g., switching between Verifiable Credential digital wallet providers).
          </li>
        </ul>

      <p>
W3C Members that would like to lean more about the motivations that led to
this work may find the
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-primer/">Primer for Decentralized Identifiers</a>
useful. There are also a set of
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-use-cases/">Decentralized Identifier Use Cases</a>
that have been curated by the various organizations implementing and deploying
this technology in commercial environments.
      </p>

      <p class="mission">
The <strong>mission</strong> of the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>
is to standardize the data model and syntax of Decentralized Identifier
Documents, which contain information related to DIDs that enable the
aforementioned use cases.

Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
The Decentralized Identifier Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>

            <dt id="syntax" class="spec">Decentralized Identifiers v1.0</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable,
"self-sovereign" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID
subject, independent from any centralized registry, identity provider, or
certificate authority. DIDs are URLs that relate a DID subject to means for
trustable interactions with that subject. DIDs resolve to DID Documents —
simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID. Each DID Document
contains at least three things: cryptographic material, authentication suites,
and service endpoints. Cryptographic material combined with authentication
suites provide a set of mechanisms to authenticate as the DID subject (e.g.,
public keys, pseudonymous biometric protocols, etc.). Service endpoints enable
trusted interactions with the DID subject. This document specifies a common
data model, format, and operations that all DIDs support.
              </p>

              <p>
The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group</a>
has developed a
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">Final Community Group Specification for Decentralized Identifiers</a>
that has been shipped in multiple production-grade commercial systems that will
serve as input for this document.

Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). 
Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in 
discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little 
formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after 
careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, 
and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including 
publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered 
provisional.

A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or 
web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the 
chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the 
resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information 
becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
This charter is written in accordance with the 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, 
and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
